I started "developing" back in middle school at the end of the school day in "HTML Club". After high school, I ended up taking a different path with a full time job selling cars. A few years later, I was selling cable and solar door to door. I ended up selling door to door for the next 5 years.

During my time in sales, I went to college and graduated with an Associates Degree in Web Application Development. This lead to my first (and current) 'technical' job as support and QA for KioWare.com.
